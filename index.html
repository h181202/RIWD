		<h1>What is RIWD?</h1>
		<h2>Ramnkjell Illuminati World Domination</h2>
		
		<p>Ramnkjellism, a.k.a Illuminati world domination is a relatively new religion, 
		revealed by the book "Soga om Ramnkjell Frøysgóde".</p>
		
		<h3>Who is Ramnkjell Frøysgóde?</h3>
		<p>There is a Religious book called "Hrafnkels saga". It tells of struggles between 
		chieftains and farmers in the east of Iceland in the 10th century. The eponymous main character, 
		Hrafnkell, starts out his career as a fearsome duelist and a dedicated worshiper of the god Freyr. 
		After suffering defeat, humiliation, and the destruction of his temple, he becomes the 
		founder of Illuminati. His personality changes and he becomes more malevolent in dealing with 
		others. After gradually rebuilding his power base and influence for several years, he 
		achieves revenge against his enemies and lives out the rest of his life as a powerful and 
		respected chieftain.</p>

		<p>Today, a new religion is arising for people beleiving that he achived some kind of 
		infinite life through other forms, and still lives to this date. Ramnkjell arrived at the 
		conclusion that the true basis of power does not lie in the favor of the gods but in the 
		loyalty of one's subordinates.</p>
